## Overview

The website is a project that simulates the operations of an existing space tourism agency. I was responsible for developing the entire frontend, ensuring it functions smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, following a responsive design approach. The site was built using React and TypeScript, leveraging the strengths of these technologies for scalability and type safety.

The design is highly engaging and visually appealing, incorporating a variety of interactive elements such as animations, smooth transitions, and a dynamic picture slideshow. These features contribute to an immersive user experience, enhancing both the aesthetic appeal and the usability of the site. Special attention was given to optimizing performance and responsiveness, ensuring fast load times and seamless interaction on all device sizes.

## My process

I initially developed the website entirely for the desktop version, ensuring all elements were properly structured and aligned with the design specifications. After confirming that the desktop layout met all functional and aesthetic requirements, I proceeded to adapt the design for tablet and mobile devices.

The mobile and tablet versions were implemented using CSS media queries, allowing for seamless responsiveness across various screen sizes without the need for a complete redesign. By adjusting layouts, typography, and element positioning through media queries, I ensured a consistent user experience across devices while maintaining the integrity of the original design.

Key aspects of the process included:

  - Desktop-first approach for optimizing performance and usability on larger screens before scaling down to smaller devices.
  - Responsive layouts that dynamically adjust content and visuals, ensuring a clean and intuitive user interface on both tablets and smartphones.
  - Testing and optimization across multiple devices and browsers to ensure cross-platform compatibility and a smooth user experience on all devices.
